An API is simply a medium to fetch or send data between interfaces. Let's say you want to make an application that provides the user with some real-time data fetched from the server or maybe even allows you to modify or add data to some other endpoint.

API - application programming interface
    web APIs
        HTTP based interface
        URL's usually called endpoints
        browsers come with web APIs that handle certain tasks in the background
            -like making requests or setTimeout



JSON - format made for computers to consume to give the live information back
    Java Script Object Notation
        just gives back data


1. We request info from an API
2. We get a string
3. We need to read that string
4. So we ask JS to turn it into a valid object *BAM* Json comes in

HTTP Verbs (requests)
    GET, POST, PUT, etc.
        get-gets information
        post-impacts the server somewhere; it posts info
    *So all API docs for example will do something different pending what request is set. document will tell what 
        CAT API PAGE:
        get/breeds gets a list of all cat breeds
        get/fact gets a list of all cat facts


Status codes
100-199 information responses
200-299 successful responses
300-399 redirection message
400-499 client error response
500-599 server error responses

API response format- API endpoints follow their browser URLs
    accepted headers
        text/html- HTML response (default)
        application/json- JSON response
        text/plain- plain text response

FETCH API
    *newer way of making requests via JS
    *supports promises
    make requests using function called fetch in JS
    send to fetch --> returns a promise --> see readable stream in header res.json returns data

    fetch("https://www.enteryourapihere")
    .then(res => {
        console.log("RESOLVED!", res)
    })
    .catch(e => {
        console.log("ERROR!", e)
    })


.then
    methods used with prmoises
        called after promise is fulfilled (resolved)
        reutrns a new promise that resolves to the value returned by the callback function

.catch
    allows you to define block of code to be executed, if error occurs in try block
    (try and catch come in pairs)

    ASYNC
The function is declared as asynchronous, enabling the use of await to handle asynchronous operations.

It constructs a URL to request a random photo from the Unsplash API based on the given location and the API access key.

The fetch function sends the request and await waits for the response.
The response is parsed as JSON, and the URL of the photo is extracted and returned.

If no photo URL is found, a default placeholder image URL is returned.
